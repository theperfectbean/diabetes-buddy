# ⚠️ CRITICAL NOTICE - SYSTEM NOT PRODUCTION READY

**DO NOT USE FOR MEDICAL DECISIONS**

This repository is in **active development** and contains known issues:

1. **Hallucination Risk**: System may generate device-specific advice without verification
2. **Incomplete Documentation**: README describes outdated architecture (v0.1.0, not current v0.3.0)
3. **No Quality Validation**: Responses lack automated accuracy verification
4. **Development Only**: Not validated for clinical use

## Current Status (Feb 2026)
- Architecture refactored (product-agnostic, user uploads)
- Safety validation: Pattern-based only (no hallucination detection)
- Testing: Development suite only (no production monitoring)

## For Developers
See CURRENT_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md for honest system assessment.

## For Users
**This tool is a personal research project.** Do not rely on its output for diabetes management without independent verification from qualified healthcare providers.
