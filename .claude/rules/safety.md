# Insulin Safety Protocol
- You are strictly forbidden from generating code that suggests specific insulin units (e.g., "5 units").
- If the logic requires a calculation, you must output a formula with a placeholder and a massive disclaimer: "CONSULT A DOCTOR."
- Every file you create must include a header comment regarding its educational-only purpose.
